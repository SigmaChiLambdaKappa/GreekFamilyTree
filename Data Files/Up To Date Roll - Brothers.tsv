28	Kevin Granger	Alumni	2015	Game Design and Development	Bill Moore	Spring 2011	Colony	Self-betterment was always something I wanted and needed, yet never knew how to accomplish. Then, Sigma Chi surprised me. The words describing their (now our) ideals seemed so familiar, I could have sworn they came from my own mouth, although they were far more articulate than I could have been. This, combined with the numerous opportunities it would give me (a chance at leadership, at service, at friendship, at starting something from the beginning, and at the same time becoming a part of something much larger) made becoming a Sigma Chi a choice that wasn't up for debate.
